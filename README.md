## Decomposition

This project is divided in three modules :

- **Commons :** include everything that could be used by other modules,
- **Starter :** responsible for downloading the launcher, making sure it is up-to-date,
- **Launcher :** responsible for launching the predefined Minecraft.

## Making your own launcher

You can make your own launcher by cloning this repository and configuring a bit some parameters.

- If you want to customize a bit the GUI, you can just change the JSON configuration files,
- If you need an advanced customization, you can change some lines of code directly.

Once you're okay with your configurations, you can build them (see [Build](#Build)).

You can find documentation on how to customize your launcher on the [wiki](https://github.com/Meltwin/ScyBlaster/wiki).

To build the launcher, you can just type the following command at the root of the project.

     mvn install

It will generate the starter and the launcher at :

- __Starter__   : ./build/ScyblasterStarter-***Version***.jar
- __Launcher__  : ./build/ScyblasterLauncher-***Version***.jar
